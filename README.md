# Jeshi la Mzalendo (Patriot's Army) Video Game

This is a fully-functional video game that I made to promote peace and other Kenyan national values and peace in the runup to the 2022 general elections.

The game can be enjoyed at <https://jeshi.lukorito.dev/>.

Jeshi la Mzalendo is a single-player game that is played in a 2D environment.

### The Game has been created using the following technologies

- HTML5 and Canvas API (for the game's UI)
- JavaScript (for the game's logic)
- Tailwind CSS
- Concepts for Maths (Trigonometry) and Physics are applied to regulate movements of objects.
-"gsap" library is employed for smoother transitions.
- Advanced concepts in Computer Graphics.
